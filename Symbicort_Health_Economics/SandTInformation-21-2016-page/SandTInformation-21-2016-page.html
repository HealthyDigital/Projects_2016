    		<strong>Symbicort® Turbuhaler® (budesonide and eformoterol fumarate dihydrate) for oral inhalation. Indications: Asthma:</strong>  Treatment of asthma where use of a combination (inhaled corticosteroid and long acting β2-agonist) is appropriate in adults and adolescents. <strong>COPD:</strong> Symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (FEV1 ≤50% predicted normal) in adults with frequent symptoms despite long acting bronchodilator use, and/or a history of recurrent exacerbations. Symbicort is not indicated for the initiation of bronchodilator therapy in COPD.   
    		<strong>Dosage: Asthma:</strong> There are two alternative treatment regimens for asthma: Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMARTTM) or Symbicort Maintenance Therapy. <strong>Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (SMARTTM) for Asthma: Symbicort 100/6 and 200/6:</strong> Adults and adolescents >12 years: 2 inhalations per day given as either 1 inhalation twice daily or 2 inhalations in either the morning or evening. For some patients a maintenance dose of Symbicort 200/6 2 inhalations twice daily may be appropriate. Patients may take an additional inhalation as needed in response to symptoms, up to 6 inhalations at one time. If patients experience a three-day period of deteriorating symptoms after taking the appropriate dose, the patient should be re-assessed. A total daily dose of up to 12 inhalations can be used temporarily. <strong>Symbicort 400/12:</strong> The 400/12 strength should not be used for Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever therapy. <strong>Symbicort Maintenance Therapy for Asthma: Symbicort 100/6 and 200/6:</strong> Adults and adolescents ≥12 years: 1–2 inhalations twice daily. <strong>Symbicort 400/12:</strong> Adults ≥18 years: 1–2 inhalations twice daily. <strong>Dosage: COPD: Symbicort 200/6:</strong> 2 inhalations twice daily. <strong>Symbicort 400/12:</strong> 1 inhalation twice daily. <strong>Contraindications:</strong> Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. <strong>Precautions:</strong> Symbicort therapy should not be initiated to treat a severe exacerbation. Not for initiation of inhaled steroids in patients transferring from oral steroids; impaired adrenal function; infections of the respiratory system; increased susceptibility to sympathomimetic amines; severe cardiovascular conditions; hypokalaemia; diabetes; impaired renal and hepatic function; pregnancy (category B3); lactation; children < 12 years. <strong>Interactions:</strong> CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg. ketoconazole); beta-receptor blockers; beta-adrenergic stimulants; sympathomimetic amines (eg. ephedrine); MAOIs; tricyclics antidepressants; quinidine; disopyramide; procainamide; phenothiazines; antihistamines associated with QT interval prolongation e.g. terfenadine, astemizole; if hypokalaemia: xanthine derivatives, mineralocorticoids, diuretics, digoxin. <strong>Adverse events:</strong> Common: tremor, palpitations, oropharyngeal candidiasis, headache, throat irritations, coughing, hoarseness; others, see full PI.
