                    <p>Intac Tactile Indicators provide walkway or
                        directional guidance for the blind or visually
                        impaired to establish an early warning of
                        impending hazards.<br /><br />

                        PVC, with self-adhesive backing for immediate
                        installation.<br /><br />
