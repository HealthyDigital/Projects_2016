                    <p>Tredmaxx Non-Slip Safety delivers non-slip
                        surfacing and stair nosing for internal or
                        external stairs, walkways and platforms.<br /><br />
                        Used as a heavy duty safety measure to secure
                        firm footing while highlighting the edge of the
                        step, Tredmaxx products are manufactured
                        from industrial grade fibre-reinforced plastic
                        (FRP) or marine grade aluminium with a silicon
                        oxide gritted wear and corrosion resistant
                        surface.<br />
                        Supplied cut to length for installation on any
                        substrate, Tredmaxx products can be easily
                        installed with adhesives and / or mechanical
                        fixings.<br /><br />

                            <li>Where required, stairs shall be constructed as follows:</li>
                            <li>(f) At the nosing, each tread shall have a strip not less than 50 mm and
                            not more than 75 mm deep across the full width of the path of travel.</li>

                            the background. Where the luminous contrasting strip is affixed to the
                            surface of the tread, any change in level shall comply with Clause 7.2 and
                            Clause 7.3.</li>
