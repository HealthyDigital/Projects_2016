                    <h2>About<br />Bikesafe</h2>

                    <p>Bikesafe Bikeway Barriers are designed to
                        provide the ultimate protection for pedestrians and cyclists travelling at speed.<br /><br />

                        Pre-engineered, preconfigured and
                        independently load tested for compliance with
                        Austroad’s safety requirements for bikeways
                        and paths.<br /><br />

                        Bikesafe Bikeway Barriers are manufactured
                        from hot dip galvanized steel with flush
                        connection points for a smoother, safer finish.

                            <li>The installation of a fence at the side of a path used by cyclists is desirable where:</li>
                            <li>there is a steep batter or large vertical drop located in close proximity to the path</li>
                            <li>•&nbsp;the path is adjacent to an arterial road and it is necessary to restrict cyclist access to the road</li>
                            <li>•&nbsp;a bridge or culvert exists on a path
                            •a hazard exists adjacent to a particular bicycle facility</li>
                            <li>•&nbsp;cyclists are likely to be ‘blazing a separate trail’ at an intersection
