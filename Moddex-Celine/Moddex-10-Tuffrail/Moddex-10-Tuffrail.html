                            <li>3.2.1.2 A toe-board complying with Clause 3.4.3 shall be provided at the edge of a platform, walkway, or landing, which is greater than 10mm distant from a permanent structure and where an object could fall more than 2000mm.</li>
                            <li>3.4.3 The toe-board shall be firmly attached to the floor or posts, and any gap between the toe-board and the floor shall not exceed 10mm. The top of the toe-board shall be not less than 100mm above the top of the floor.</li>
                            <li>5.4 GUARDRAILING</li>
                            <li>5.4.1 Provision of guardrailing</li>
                            <li>Guardrailing complying with Clause 6.2.1 shall be installed on all sides and ends of a walkway except in the following situations:</li>
                            <li>(a) At the points of access from a stairway or ladder.</li>
                            <li>(b) Where there is a permanent structure not more than 100 mm distant from the edge of the walkway, capable of providing protection at least equivalent to that of guardrailing.</li>
                            <li>(c) On the sides and ends of a walking surface that is not more than 300mm above an adjacent area upon which it is safe to step or stand without risk of falling, and—</li>
                            <li>(i) the slope of the walkway perpendicular to the direction of travel (cross-slope) does not exceed 3°;</li>
                            <li>(ii) the angle of slope of the adjacent area is less than 12°; and (iii) the width of the area adjacent to the walkway is greater than 2000mm</li>
                            <li>5.4.2 Requirements for walkways with slopes within the range of 15° to 20°</li>
                            <li>On sloping walkways between 15° and 20°, a handrail complying with Clause 5.6 shall be provided. Where there is a risk of a person sliding or rolling along the sloping surface of the walkway, a means of limiting this linear distance to 18 m shall be installed.</li>
                            <li>NOTE: On walkway slopes of lesser angles where there is a risk of a person sliding, a handrail should also be provided.</li>

                            <li>A toeboard complying with Clause 6.1.2 shall be installed on the edge of a walkway where there is no permanent structure within 10 mm of the edge, and from which an object could fall to where persons have access to the area below and to the side of the walkway. Any gap between the underside of the toeboard and the walkway surface shall be not greater than 10 mm. The top of the toeboard shall be not less than 100 mm above the floor.</li>
