                        <ul>
                            <li>(a) A continuous balustrade or other barrier, except for a barrier provided to an openable window covered by D2.24, must be provided along the side of any roof to which public access is provided, any stairway or ramp, any floor, corridor, hallway, balcony, deck, veranda, mezzanine, access bridge or the like and along the side of any delineated path of access to a building, if—</li>
                            <li>(ii) it is not bounded by a wall; and</li>
                            <li>(iii) its level above the surface beneath, is more than 1 m.</li>
                            <li>(h) Openings in a balustrade or other barrier must be constructed in accordance with the following:</li>
                            <li>(ii) For a balustrade or other barrier other than those provided under</li>
                            <li>(c)— </li>
                            <li>(A) any opening does not permit a 125 mm sphere to pass through it and for stairs, the opening is measured above the nosing line of the stair treads; and</li>
                           <li>(B) for floors more than 4 m above the surface beneath, any horizontal or near horizontal elements between 150 mm and 760 mm above the floor must not facilitate climbing.</li>

                            <li>Barriers, including parapets, balustrades and railings, together with
                            members and connections that provide structural support, shall be
                            designed to sustain the imposed actions given in Table 3.3. The top edge
                            or handrail shall also be designed for the case where a concentrated
                            load of 0.6 kN, positioned for the worst effect, acts inward, outward or
                            downward.</li>

                            considered as three separate load cases.</li>
